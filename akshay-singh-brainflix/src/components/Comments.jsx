              They BLEW the ROOF off at their last event, once everyone started
              figuring out they were going. This is still simply the greatest
              opening of an event I have EVER witnessed.

              Every time I see him shred I feel so motivated to get off my couch and
              hop on my board. He’s so talented! I wish I can ride like him one day
              so I can really enjoy myself!

              How can someone be so good!!! You can tell he lives for this and loves
              to do it every day. Everytime I see him I feel instantly happy! He’s
              definitely my favorite ever!
